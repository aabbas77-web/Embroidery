Varian Led studio contains a large number of components, objects 
and routines for Borland Delphi with full source code. This 
library is designed for Borland Delphi 3/4/5 and C++ Builder 4. 

Everybody can build applications with Delphi. But take a 
lead in development just by using the Varian Led Studio component 
toolkit. No extensive programming required, easy to use and most 
important, no need to read any manuals before you can start. 
So, just click and play. 

Rapid application development is still our main goal... 

Written in Delphi, these native code components are fully integrated 
into the environment. Varian Led Studio takes your applications to the 
next level over a dozen professional-quality components. We would be 
glad about some suggestions or some criticism for an improvement of 
this package. Therefore we hope for a large feedback!
