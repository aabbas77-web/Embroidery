GraphicEx 3.3:

This unit is an enhancement to Graphics.pas to provide you with image types to load other than BMP, ICO and WMF/EMF. See the unit header for a list of supported image types.

Usage:
1) Include the unit somewhere in a project and you can then use TPicture to load all new image types.
2) Include the unit into a package installed in your component palette (doesn't really matter where, just add it to a package) and you will have all those additional image types also available at design time.

Ciao, Mike
