Graphics32 Change Log
=====================


v0.9 (9-Mar-2000)
  First release. Version 0.9.

v0.91 (10-Mar-2000)
  Some changes in TImage32 component to reduce flicker when 
  DoubleBuffered is turned off.
  Fixed the multithreading example.

v0.92 (16-Mar-2000)
  Sprite scaling is added.
  Removed Transparent and UseAlpha from TBitmap32 properties. 
  A new property DrawMode is introduced instead.
  Windows 95 and NT compatibility compiler directive is added. 
  TImage32 example is updated and Win95/NT version is posted.
  See updated documentation for details. 

v0.92a (17-Mar-2000)
  Win95/NT support bug fixed. This version emulates both 
  bitmap transparency and bitmap alpha blending functions
  from msimg32.dll, however this emulation is not optimized
  and will be slower compared to msimg32.dll.
  Some other small bugs found and destroyed.

v0.93 (23-Mar-2000)
  Added baTile mode to TImage32.BitmapAlign property.
  Added linear transformations (See documentation). 
  EndUpdate method of TBitmap32 now does not generate change 
  notification. The Changed method must be called explicitly.
  New example on linear transformation is available.
  A few improvements in pixel and line antialiasing.

v0.94 (31-Mar-2000)
  Added a new unit for byte array mapping. A little 
  reorganization in OnChange event generation. Fixed a bug in
  DrawLineF/FS functions, when the last point (or part of it)
  was not always there it was supposed to be. 
  
v0.95 (5-Apr-2000)
  Added MMX optimization for pixel blending. It is also used 
  to accelerate bilinear interpolation when performing linear 
  transformations. Well, not a huge increase in performance,
  but still something. Alternative non-MMX code was rearranged
  to increase the instruction pairing. It works a bit faster 
  now. A few bugs with color algebra were eliminated. A couple 
  of links regarding low-level optimization is added.

v0.97 (29-Apr-2000)
  Complete redesign, no more MMX-specific code since the new
  integer version works just as fast, no more msimg32.dll 
  dependence. New double buffering scheme, new change 
  notification scheme, completely redesigned overlay layers 
  implementation, new scaling and linear trannsformation 
  implementation. Overall speed improevement.

v0.97a (1-May-2000)
  A bug with FillRectS, FillRectTS fixed. Added a SmartResize 
  property to TPaintBox32, it helps to reduce the amount of 
  back-buffer reallocations when the control resizes.

v0.98 (17-May-2000)
  Delphi4 compatibility. New MMX optimization code with 
  automatic MMX detection. A small fix in Bresenham's 
  implementation. DrawLine* functions now have parameter 
  controlling drawing of the last pixel. Added MoveTo*, 
  LineTo* functions. Added text blending/antialiasing. Added 
  polylines and polygons. DrawLineA* functions now support 
  line opacity. Added G32Bench.xls file with performance test 
  results. Some other small fixes. New examples.

v0.98a (22-May-2000)
  A little optimization in TBitmap32.RenderText. A bug in 
  Intensity function fixed. Some fix-ups in PolygonTS.

v0.98b (3-June-2000)
  Just a few bug fixes.

v0.98c (19-July-2000)
  This release should be considered as beta for v0.99. 
  It contains most of the features planned for v0.99. 
  I release it mostly to check the C++ Builder compatibility, 
  and keep you up-to-date with the current development state. 
  Note, that documentation is not completely updated. DrawLine* 
  functions are changed to Line*. Added an ability to customize 
  bitmap blending equation. Better and faster buffering in 
  TPaintBox32 and its descendants. Perspective transformations 
  are now possible as well. Introduced a new TFixed fixed 
  point data type. A new unit, implementing controls similar 
  to scroll bars is available together with sample control 
  showing how to implement scroll bars with TImage32. Sample 
  control showing how to implement rubber-banding with layers 
  is available as well. New 'X' postfix is introduced to some 
  line drawing routines than operate directly over fixed point 
  arguments.
  
v0.99 (9-September-2000)
  New documentation is available in HTML Help format.
  Changed unit names. Changed implementation of TImage32 and
  layers (see docs). New TPaintBox32 does not support layers. 
  TBitmapList32 is renamed to TBitmap32List and a little bit
  simplified. An couple of bugs fixed in TBitmap32.SetSize. 
  One of them could lead to resource leakage. Also fixed a
  bug in design-time streaming. TImgView32, a new control 
  introduced in v0.98c is improved and now it is a descendant
  of TImage32.

v0.99a (11-September-2000)
  Updated resampling code in G32_Transforms.pas. More than 
  2 times improvement in sfNearest resampling and sfLinear
  resampling works up to 5 times faster.
