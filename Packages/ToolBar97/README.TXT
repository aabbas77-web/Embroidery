Toolbar97 is a free dockable toolbar component for Delphi 2.0, 3.0, and C++Builder that features the new Office 97 look and behavior. Some of its features include:

Ability to drag and dock toolbars to any side of a form, or leave them floating. Multiple toolbars can lined up side-by-side or in rows.
Full source code for customization if necessary.
Includes a TToolbarButton97 control that looks and works just like the buttons in Office 97.
Includes a TEdit97 control for creating Office 97-style edit controls on toolbars.
Ability to save and load its position from the registry (see below).
Doesn't require the new COMCTL32.DLL to run, as Delphi 3's TToolBar (when flat) and TCoolBar components do.
Tested and certified to work on Windows 95, NT 4.0, and 3.51.
Only adds a 30KB footprint to your program!
